# 🛍️ E-Commerce App — Domain Layer Refactoring

This project focuses on refactoring the **domain layer** of the e-commerce Flutter app following **Clean Architecture** principles and callable use cases.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Product Entity** with core attributes (`id`, `name`, `description`, `imageUrl`, `price`)
- **Use Cases** implemented as callable classes:
    - View all products
    - View a product by ID
    - Create a new product
    - Update an existing product
    - Delete a product by ID
- Clear separation of **domain logic** from UI and data persistence
- In-memory product list simulates data storage for domain use cases
