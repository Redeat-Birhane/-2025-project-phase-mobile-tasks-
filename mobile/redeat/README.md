This task involves implementing and testing a local data source for caching products using SharedPreferences. It helps ensure the app works offline or loads temporary data while fetching from the server.

âœ… Features Implemented
Created ProductLocalDataSourceImpl class to handle local storage of products.

Used SharedPreferences to cache product lists as JSON strings.

Implemented methods to:

Cache a list of products

Retrieve all cached products

Retrieve a single cached product by ID

Handled edge cases (e.g., no cache) using a custom CacheException.

ðŸ§ª Unit Testing
Created unit tests for:

cacheProducts() â€“ ensures products are stored locally.

getCachedProducts() â€“ retrieves cached products or throws exception.

getCachedProduct(String id) â€“ retrieves a single product or throws exception.

Used mockito to mock SharedPreferences.
